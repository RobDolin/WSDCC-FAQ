On January 29th, 2019, Mr. Roberts posted an announcement.  As of January 2021, the text of that announcement is: 
Online Code of Conduct & Disclaimer.
In order to ensure this forum is a welcoming place for participants, we have created this online code of conduct (with appreciation to the 36th LD for the template). 
As a reminder, this group is not a venue to conduct official business, but a place to share information relevant to the work of the WSDCC. Not all potential members are part of this group and there are many members who may not have accounts or regularly check Facebook.
The way the group is set up, potential members must be invited to join this group. If you are a Facebook friend with someone who should be a member, please invite them.
