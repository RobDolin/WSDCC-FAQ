PCOs take office at the end of November.  In December and January, each (county or LD) local party organization holds a "re-organization" where the PCOs elect officers including a Chair, (1st) Vice Chair, and two State Committee Members.  Some local party organizations elect other officer positions such as multiple Vice Chairs, Secretary, Treasurer, such as At-Large, Communications, Elections, Events, Fundraising, Membership, Recruitment, and more.  Some local party organizations also allow for other non-PCO members to vote on other positions.
